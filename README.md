Pontarius Service
=================

This is a work in progress of a service that will manage the configurations,
credentials, and local storage, of Pontarius users. It will expose its API over
the D-BUS inter-process communication protocol. This enables Pontarius to be
integrated with other applications, such as
[FreeDesktop.org](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/) environments.
